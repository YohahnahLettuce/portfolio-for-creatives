      <h3>Who is she?</h3>
      <p>Hi, I'm Yohahnah!
        
        (You pronounce it Yo-haw-nuh)

        I’m an illustrator and designer who has learnt how to listen to others without thinking about what to say next. I don’t mind silences, it allows time for people to complete what they want to say. That ability helps me understand what is being communicated and informs my thinking about how to create solutions that work for you..</p> 
        
        <p>When i’m not listening closely, I love reading (fantasy fiction), playing soccer (no one gets past me in midfield), and doting on my plants (I have a humble collection of devil’s ivy). </p>
        
        <p>I’m a soon to be graduate of the IDEA School of Design at Capilano University, and now looking for a full time junior designer position. If you have a  moment please have a look through my portfolio, and reach out if you think I might be able to help in your practice or on a project.</p>
